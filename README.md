## ✍ Gatsby Blog

My blog is inspired by [Dan Abramov's](https://overreacted.io/) blog which is forked from the [Gatsby Starter Blog](https://gatsby-starter-blog-demo.netlify.app/) by [Kyle Matthews](https://github.com/KyleAMathews).

I loved the simplicity of Dan's blog and added a bunch of features below during my journey in learning React and Gatsby.

## 🔌 Features added to the starter blog

The starter blog didn't have the features that I was looking for so I did some research and found resources to guide me in adding the features below:

1.  **Added extra pages**

    Added about me and now page in Bio component by following Gatsby guide [here](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/docs/creating-and-modifying-pages/)

2.  **Added reading time and tea icons**

    Added number of teas based on the length of the blog post. Followed Gatsby documentation [here](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/docs/creating-and-modifying-pages/)

3.  **Added tags page**

    Followed Gatsby documentation [here](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/docs/adding-tags-and-categories-to-blog-posts/). Also added clickable tags on each post page by querying from GraphQL.

4.  **Pagination**

    Followed Gatsby documentation [here](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/docs/adding-pagination/). Gatsby starter blog had previous and next page but did not have pagination set-up, I also followed this guide [here](https://nickymeuleman.netlify.com/blog/gatsby-pagination) to complete pagination.

5.  **Dark mode toggle**

    Followed Gatsby blog tutorial [here](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/blog/2019-01-31-using-react-context-api-with-gatsby/). Used `<ThemeContext.Provider>` in React to toggle dark and light mode with [React Switch](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-switch)

6.  **Added Font Awesome**

    Added React Font Awesome using [react-icons](https://github.com/react-icons/react-icons) library, specifically for my Github and LinkedIn and Twitter logo.

7.  **Prismjs**

    To allow for code syntax highlighting based on language. Gatsby documentation [here](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/packages/gatsby-remark-prismjs/) and followed external post [here](https://dev.to/niklasmtj/implement-prismjs-in-gatsbyjs-fff)

8.  **Added Algolia's Search**

    Installed [Algolia's](https://www.algolia.com/) search functionality. Instructions on how I did this on this blog [here](https://kiendang.me/082-Algolia-install/)

9.  **Added MDX support for blog posts**

    Followed this guide [here](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/packages/gatsby-plugin-mdx/) to integrate MDX which allows for React components in Markdown files.

Please feel free to fork this repo and make it your own!

Give me a tweet @ k1dang: I would love to see what other features are added and customized to this template blog!
