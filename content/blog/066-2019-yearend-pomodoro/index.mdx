Now that 2019 is officially over, I felt that a year end summary would be a good post to have.

In May, I created this blog to keep me accountable for my journey and wanted to document my progress with programming. My initial interest in programming started from [automating a part of my job using Excel](/029-automated-job-process/). Ever since, I've been dedicating 2019 to learning new technologies to gain the skills to be a web developer.

Tracking my time and progress has been important in identifying my strengths and weaknesses, thus, allowing me to re-organizing my efforts in learning. I have been using the
[Pomodoro Technique](/022-pomodoro-technique) to monitor my productivity and manage my time throughout my journey.

As someone who loves to finding ways to constantly improve, learning effectively has been one of my top goals. The Pomodoro Technique has helped me improve my study habits and achieve my goals. I know I still have a long way to go and I will continue to my journey lifelong learner.

# <center>Reflection</center>

In the beginning of 2019, I decided to learn how to make applications and started with android for a bit, I quickly realized it was very difficult because I had to learn Java on top of the android studio developer kit. I became overwhelemed and found that developing web applications was easier to learn.

I quickly burned out after the initial motivation from January; Pomodoro's were supposed to keep me focused but I had no energy left after work. I noticed when you're staring at the computer all day for work, the last thing you want to do is have your eyes glued to the monitor when you're at home.

I made the decision to resign to free up time and energy from a position that didn't align with my career goals.

I jumped into React after learning HTML and CSS. I knew enough React to start playing with Gatsby and read through the documentation to start my blog. I was missing the fundamentals with JavaScript so I decided to back peddle by taking a JavaScript modern bootcamp and then a Nodejs course to iron out any missing knowledge.

### <center>The highs and lows</center>

Unfortunately, a month after my resignation I was hit with a terrible infection which left me unable to focus for months.

After four exhausting months of recovery, taking [9 courses of antibiotics](/tags/biochemistry/), [4 different opioids](/062-opioids/) and having 2 surgeries, I stuck with my <a href="https://dev.to/kdang/trust-the-process-the-pomodoro-technique-2a37" target="_blank">Pomodoro process</a> to build momentum and managed to complete two online courses and create my personal blog using Gatsby.

The most important lesson I've learned this year is that things will never go according to plan and life just gets in the way. There are factors outside of our control and we'll just have to find a way to deal with them.

Despite being through a lot of physical pain and mental exhaustion, I learned a lot about myself and how I deal with hardships. I found that being healthy is a blessing and that it's usually taken for granted until you become sick.
