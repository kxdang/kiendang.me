**Biochemistry** - A branch of science that explores chemical processes within and related to living organisms. By using chemical knowledge and techniques, biochemists can understand and solve biological problems.

The journey of completing my degree at the University of Waterloo shaped me who I am today.

#### <center><h2>**THE BEGINNING**</h2></center>

At the time in high school, everyone rushed out to get early acceptance in Grade 12. It was either business or science from what I knew as a young kid. Perhaps it was the lack of exposure to computer science courses in high school had failed to spark my interest in pursuing a CS background.

Being 17, a typical young teen who just enjoyed playing games all day, I had no aspirations to figure what I wanted and failed to do the proper research. I did really well in high school and felt confident in pursuing higher education which led me to the University of Waterloo in hopes that I’d find a career in science. All the choices I’ve made have really shaped who I am today and I’m happy to say I don’t regret any of it.

The experience of my undergrad is irreplaceable. I struggled hard and put in lots of work **just to pass** and I enjoyed my fair share of parties and I made a lot of awesome friends.

When I said I struggled hard, I meant it. I failed courses along the way but managed to pull through. I failed the second physics course, analytical methods in molecular biology, organic chemistry and eventually dropped out of chemical thermodynamics because my fundamentals in physics weren't good enough to understand the course material. The balance of coursework, labs, and the co-op interviews were a huge part of my stress in undergrad.

The experience of going from high school to university was night and day. Finally being away from home and having the freedom to skip or do anything during your own time was a reality I was not prepared for.

During my 2B term, dubbed “_2B or not to be_”, where most people will either have a good chance of graduating or failing my program, I really felt I was going to be in the latter. I couldn’t figure out how to stay afloat even when I had tried really hard. With all the pressure of dropping out, I’d be disappointing my parents and also coming out with a large loan.

My girlfriend, who was also going through the same struggle, told me something that would completely change the way I approached my academics. She told me that **I \*\***forgot how to learn.\*\* I realized my way of learning when I was in high school was through memorization.

I started to find techniques on how to learn and started to focus on understanding concepts that allowed me to grind through the 2B term and make it on to 3A. I was able to finish all the required courses, including the courses I failed.

Eventually, after many co-op experiences, I realized science wasn't for me. I was already so far in my program, I wanted to see it through to the end.  Throughout this journey, I’ve learned a lot about myself and developed the proper habits to achieve my goals. I was able to stick through the hardships and found out how to make study habits stick and grow from my failures.

This perseverance led me to my success in achieving a Bachelors of Science in Honours Biochemistry.

Biochemistry has taught me the core fundamentals of science and understanding life through a biochemical lens. It has shaped the way I think, how I view and solve problems and the way I do my research.

It has been the catalyst for me to keep up with the latest scientific trends which includes the discovery of CRISPR Cas9 technology. A technology I think will most likely change the world. I'm glad to be able to understand the scientific methods at a biochemical level.

It has been 2 years since I've touched any science related work as of writing this post. It has given me a deep appreciation of the science academia and their contributions to improving the quality of human life.

A degree is what you make out of it, for me, it has laid the fundamentals of learning and persevering through hardships as it arises. It has made me become the person who I am, a life long learner. I look forward to learning new technologies and use these skills to develop my own path.
